# LAN-Connection-PCGame

This is my repository to create simple client server using python and added several features to it.


# Instructions

1. Simply run the server file to start the server. It will show the UI at which it is running.
2. Run the client file to connect to the server using server IP.
3. Send instructions from client and back.

Bunch of other features are also added. Explore them as you run them.

Compile the file as .exe and run without IDE:

 `pyinstaller --noconsole server.py
`

`pyinstaller --noconsole client.py
`
